# Welcome to Kalango Game Studio! 🦎🎮

## Objective
We came together to create games much like a band creates music. But instead of musical instruments, we use **open source** to craft **free games**. This approach allows us to refine our skills and expand our knowledge while building what we call our "shelf"—a growing collection of projects, prototypes, assets, ideas, and more. This "shelf" is not just for us but for the community we aspire to cultivate and support.

## About Us  
We are **Kalango Game Studio**, a collaborative and independent game development team.  
Using the **Godot engine** and free software, we create fun, engaging, and accessible games for everyone.  
Our mission is to **learn, share, and build**—not just games, but a community.
