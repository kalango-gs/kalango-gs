# Welcome to Kalango Game Studio! ðŸ¦ŽðŸŽ®

## About Us  
We came together to create games much like a band creates music. But instead of musical instruments, we use **open source** to craft **free games**. This approach allows us to refine our skills and expand our knowledge while building what we call our "shelf"â€”a growing collection of projects, prototypes, assets, ideas, and more. This "shelf" is not just for us but for the community we aspire to cultivate and support.
